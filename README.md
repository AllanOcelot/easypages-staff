Easypages Staff is a plugin for Wordpress that allows you to quickly and effortlessly add a "Staff" section to any existing Wordpress site.
The plugin creates a custom post type behind the scenes and allows you to add staff members via the Wordpress admin menu.

#Shortcodes and Shortcode options:
 The following are shortcodes, along with their options:

 ```
  ['easystaff']
 ```
 This is the main shortcode and will query all existing staff members and output them with our HTML. You can give the short code the following options.

 ```
   //How many staff members should there be on a single row? (Takes INT value. 1-4. Default: 4.)
   staff_per_row =  4

   //Should the staff members name link to their post type? (Takes boolean value: true / false. Default: true.)
   staffname_is_link = true

   //Should the staff member's roles be visible (Takes boolean value: true / false. Default: true.)
   rolesEnabled = true

   //Display link to the staff members profile page as a button? (Takes boolean value: true / false. Default: true.)
   staffname_button_visible = true
   //If so, what text should it have? (Takes a string. Default: "Read More")
   staffname_button_text  = "Read More"

 ```

#Single Staff Page?
The plugin is built around Wordpress's fantastic custom post type structure, meaning each staff member can have their own profile page (Enabled by default).
This page is useful if you wish to give a history of the employee, or conduct an "interview" style biography. Each profile contains a Banner image, a content block and with other staff members being displayed at the bottom of the page.
